# Experiments Discord Bot

Welcome to the **Experiments Discord Bot** project! This bot, named "Experiments," was created to test various features related to Discord bot development. It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with different functionalities, integrations, and bot behavior on the Discord platform.

***

## About the Project

**Experiments** is a Discord bot built using the `discord.py` library. The primary purpose of this bot is to experiment with and test various features of Discord bot development. Whether it's working with message commands, slash commands, event handling, or custom integrations, this bot is designed to help explore different possibilities in a controlled environment.

## Features

The bot is currently equipped with a range of features which you can use to help you build your own Discord bot, including but not limited to:

* Syncing the Application Commands Globally
* Checking Latency
* Link Shortening

These features are constantly evolving as new experiments and tests are conducted.

## Usage

This bot is intended for experimentation and testing. You can modify the code to add new commands, events, or integrations. Check the `main.py` file and other files in the repository to see how existing features are implemented. The main purpose of the code being open sourced is for beginner discord.py developers to understand how certain things may work. Everything in the main branch will be in full working order, other branches could be broken!
